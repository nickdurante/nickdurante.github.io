I’m originally from Turin, Italy, with a background in Telecommunications Engineering from Politecnico di Torino and Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya.

I’m an experienced technical manager with a strong background in IT engineering and innovation. I’ve led high-impact projects across diverse sectors, including large corporations, academic institutions, and startups. My work includes H2020 and HE Critical Infrastructure Protection initiatives, where I’ve driven the development of cutting-edge solutions, such as Digital Twins, and coordinated cross-functional teams to deliver results at scale.

My work in cryptography and cybersecurity began during my Master’s, and since then, I’ve authored multiple peer-reviewed publications and developed a range of solutions, including a cryptographic device designed for my M.Sc. thesis to enhance data security and privacy.

A lifelong interest in aerospace, sparked by the stories of Yuri Gagarin and Apollo 11, was further fueled by my visit to Cape Canaveral as a teen. Today, this passion remains a key motivator in my work.

When I’m not managing projects or diving into technical work, you can find me engaging in DIY projects or enjoying outdoor activities like snowboarding, trekking, football, and tennis.
