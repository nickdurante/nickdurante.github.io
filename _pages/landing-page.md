### Welcome!

This is the space where I like to gather and share my thoughts, ideas, small fixes to everyday tech issues and so on.

Beyond my technical work, I’m passionate about the outdoors. Whether I’m hitting the slopes for some snowboarding, exploring new hiking trails, or working on hands-on DIY projects, I love staying active and embracing new challenges. Football and tennis also keep me moving and engaged in friendly competition.

If you want to contact me you can find me on Linkedin and GitHub, alternatively just drop a comment on an article.
