### Welcome!

This is the space where I like to gather and share my thoughts and ideas.

I'm extremely fond of the mountains and in my free time when I'm not programming you can find me busy on DIY projects, snowboarding, trekking, playing football or tennis.

If you want to contact me you can find me on Linkedin and GitHub, alternatively just drop a comment on an article.
